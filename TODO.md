## Features

### Sub-agents

-   Add a sub-agent to determine if the AI has more to add after they use a tool. May either replace or complement the current reprompt flag.

### Diff view

-   Allow the user to edit diff chunks before writing a file, just like the user can modify commands.

### Context management

-   Always proactively read aidev.yaml file.
-   Include up-to-date `read_directories` output in the context.
-   Allow users to control the context explicitly (remove files, for example).

### Personas

-   Allow additional assistant personas (defined by the user) to check each other's output.
